# Temporal Java Examples

## Java Core Examples
- [Hello Workflow](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/hello-workflow) - demonstrates how to define, set up, and execute a basic Temporal Workflow.
- [Hello Activity](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/hello-activity) - demonstrates how to define, set up, and execute a basic Temporal Workflow with a single Activity.
- [Exclusive Choice](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/exclusive-choice) - demonstrates how to execute workflows with changing input data.
- [External Microservice](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/external-microservice) - demonstrates how to execute workflows that interact with an external microservice.
- [Hello Async](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/hello-async) - demonstrates how to execute Activities asynchronously and wait for them using Promises.
- [Hello Await](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/hello-await) - demonstrates how to use Await statement to wait for a condition.
- [Parallel Activities](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/parallel-multiple-activities) - demonstrates how to execute multiple Activities in parallel, asynchronously, and wait for them using `Promise.allOf`.
- [Async Activity Completion](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/async-activity-completion) - demonstrates how to complete an Activity Execution asynchronously.
- [Hello Async Lambda](https://github.com/alisktl/temporal-java-examples/tree/main/core/async-lambda) - demonstrates how to execute part of a Workflow asynchronously in a separate task (thread).
