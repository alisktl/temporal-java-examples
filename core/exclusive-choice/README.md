# Exclusive Temporal Fruit Ordering Workflow

This example demonstrates using Temporal for workflow orchestration. The example includes a simple workflow for purchasing fruits. The workflow orchestrates various activities, such as ordering different types of fruits using `OrderFruitsActivities`, and processes a shopping list provided by the user.

## Prerequisites

Before running the commands, ensure that the following are installed on your system:

- **Java 8 or newer**: The project uses Maven to manage dependencies and build the project.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool used to compile and manage dependencies.
- **Temporal Server**: Temporal's local development server for running workflows.

## Project Overview
### 1. PurchaseFruitsWorkflow
This is the main workflow that orchestrates the execution of fruit ordering activities. It processes a shopping list and delegates tasks to the appropriate activities to order the fruits.

### 2. OrderFruitsActivities
This interface defines the activities that the `PurchaseFruitsWorkflow` relies on. Activities are the actual units of work that run outside the workflow's context. For this example, `OrderFruitsActivities` contains methods to order different fruits:

- `orderApples(int amount)`: Orders a specified amount of apples.
- `orderBananas(int amount)`: Orders a specified amount of bananas.
- `orderCherries(int amount)`: Orders a specified amount of cherries.
- `orderOranges(int amount)`: Orders a specified amount of oranges.

The `OrderFruitsActivitiesImpl` class provides the implementation for these activities.

## Setup and Running the Example

Follow these steps to set up and run the Temporal workflow example.

### 1. Start Temporal Server in Development Mode

To start the Temporal server locally with a UI at port `8080`, run the following command:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --ui-port 8080
```

This starts a local Temporal server and its associated web UI for monitoring workflows. You can access the UI at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. Build the Project

Use Maven to clean and install the project. This command will remove any previous builds and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 3. Compile the Project

After installing the dependencies, compile the project using:

```bash
mvn compile
```

### 4. Start the Workflow Worker

Next, run the worker that listens for tasks on the task queue and processes the workflows. This will start the `PurchaseFruitsWorker` class:

```bash
mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="org.temporal.example.PurchaseFruitsWorker" \
    -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=warn
```

This command starts the worker that listens for tasks and executes the workflows.

### 5. Start the Workflow (Starter)

Finally, run the `Starter` class to start the `PurchaseFruitsWorkflow` and pass a shopping list to the workflow. This will trigger the workflow and print the result:

```bash
mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="org.temporal.example.Starter" \
    -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=warn
```

### Output

After running the Starter command, you should see output like the following:

```
Order results: Ordered 4 Oranges...Ordered 8 Apples...Ordered 1 Cherries...Ordered 5 Bananas...
```

### Troubleshooting

- Logs and Debugging: If you encounter issues, consider changing the log level from `warn` to `debug` for more detailed logging:

```bash
-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=debug
```

- **Temporal UI**: If the Temporal UI is not loading on `http://localhost:8080`, ensure that the server started correctly and that the port is not being blocked by any firewall or other services.
